Extract from my work, you can a [demo](http://icerdesign.com/about/#/skills) in live
Combined sunburst and line chart, currently you must generate the data by yourself, I also uploaded the skills.xlsx file to help generate this file(`skillsdata.js`).

Features:

* [TODO]works with data that is in a CSV format (you don't need to pre-generate a hierarchical JSON file, unless your data file is very large) 
* interactive breadcrumb trail helps to emphasize the sequence, so that it is easy for a first-time user to understand what they are seeing

If you want to simply reuse this with your own data, here are some tips for generating the `skillsdata.js` file:

* Fill in your data to skills.xlsx
* Select whole `W` column and copy
* Convert to js by using http://js2coffee.org/
* Save and overwrite to `skillsdata.js` file

Indeed, I'm greatly inspired by someone else, but now I can't find who he is and where his site located, maybe I'll add his site link here later, if you do, please let me know, thanks!
